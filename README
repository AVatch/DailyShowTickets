Description:
	Quick python script thrown together to make getting tickets to the
	Daily Show with John Stewart easy.
	
	Just run and when tickets are availible a browser will open to the 
	URL
		www.dailyshow.com/tickets
	

	This in principle can be easily made to work for the Colbert Report
	since both sites are more or less identical.

	If anyone wants to make this better(i.e. error handling, tighty things
	up, etc) feel free to do so :)
